There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

**Example 1**:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
**Example 2**:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

**Constraints**:

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- 1 <= numCourses <= 10^5

        in_degree = [0]*numCourses
        # record # of vertices added to topo sorted list
        counter = 0
        queue = deque()
        # build graph
        for node_in, node_out in prerequisites:
            graph[node_out].append(node_in)
            in_degree[node_in] += 1
        
        # add vertices with 0 ingree into queue
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if in_degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i) 
        while queue:
            cur = queue.popleft()
            counter += 1 
            
#delete children edge and decrement indegree by 1 untill children's indegree is 0, and then push children to queue
            for child in graph[cur]:
                in_degree[child] -= 1
                if in_degree[child] == 0:
                    queue.append(child)
        return counter == numCourses

```
