        main idea: min PQ,   (pair_sum,i_A,j_B) 
        constrains: (1) for each array, we consider at most k elements 
                    (2) for each val in A, if its smallest pairt in B at pos j is pop off, its next smallest pair is at pos j+1 
                    (3) in the beginning, use smallest val in B to get k pairs in A 
        1. take smallest in A as start, get k pairs in B, push into PQ 
        2. each time pop one pair, update res, update cnt, increment index in B (if within boundry), push bach to pq 
        3. stop when eighter count reaches k or pq is empty already 
        """
