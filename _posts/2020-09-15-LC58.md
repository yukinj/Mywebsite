class Solution:
    # time O(N) space O(N) 
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(s)-1
        # get the right space 
        while r>=0 and s[r] == ' ':
            r -= 1
        # count the last word (devided by space) by increamenting l
        while r>= 0 and s[r] != ' ':
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return l
