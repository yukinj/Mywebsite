deep copy:  copy fields which are not reference of an object, which means objects need to be reconstructed and then be saved to the corresponding field of the target field which stores object reference.
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    # time O(2N)  space O(1)
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        p1 = p2 =  head 
        d = dict()
        d[None] = None
        # step1, save all nodes in a dictionary as keys and refer to a new node with only node.val   
        while p1: 
            d[p1] = Node(p1.val)  # create a new node 
            p1 = p1.next 
        # step2:  for each node, based on original node's reference(next and random) to generate new Node and connect with nodes that generated in step 1
