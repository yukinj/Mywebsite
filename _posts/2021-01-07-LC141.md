```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
"""
Note all the nodes can have duplicate value 
approach 1: use set to track if current node has been visited
tc O(N) sc O(N)
approach 2: fast and slow pointer 
tc O(N)  sc O(1)
main idea: set fast pointer and slow pointer - each time fast pointer move one step more than slow pointer
if fast pointer ever catch up slow pointer, there is a cycle

follow up: we can get the length of circle by start counting when fast and slow pointer encounter each other. The next time they meet again is the length of the circle 
"""
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        p = head  
        q = head 
        while q is not None and q.next is not None:
            p = p.next 
            q = q.next.next
            if p is q:   
                return True
        return False 
```

About Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Floyd's Cyclec Detection algorithm): 
**main idea**
if you have two pointers in a Singly Linked list, one moving twice as fast (the hare) than the other (the tortoise), then if they intersect, there is a cycle in the linked list. If they don't intersect, then there is no cycle.
