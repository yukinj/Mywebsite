time O(N) space O(1)
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head:
             return False 
        sl,fa = head,head 
        # can be also written  while fa and fa.next ,  main idea is to loop turil fast ptr reached to end of linked list
        while fa.next and fa.next.next: # loop termination condition is bounded to fast pointer 
            fa = fa.next.next
            sl = sl.next
            if fa == sl:
                return True 
        return False
```

About Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Floyd's Cyclec Detection algorithm): 
**main idea**
if you have two pointers in a Singly Linked list, one moving twice as fast (the hare) than the other (the tortoise), then if they intersect, there is a cycle in the linked list. If they don't intersect, then there is no cycle.
