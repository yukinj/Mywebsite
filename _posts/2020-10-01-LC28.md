```python
"""
main idea: use string == string2 comparison. since target string is fixed(needle) => length already know. all we need to do is to loop through string1, each index check start from current index to length of needle, if it's same as needle 
edge case: needle = '' ; optimization: len(haystack) < len(needle), can terminate early
"""
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        # time O(N) space O(1)
        if not needle:
            return 0
        if len(haystack) < len(needle):
            return -1
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1
