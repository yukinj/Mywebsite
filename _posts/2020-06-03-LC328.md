Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
```

**Constraints**:

- The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
- The length of the linked list is between [0, 10^4].

```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# time O(N+K) where K is number of loops fast pointer goes through
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return head
        odd = head
        even = head.next
        eHead = even
        while even and even.next:
            odd.next = odd.next.next
            even.next = even.next.next
            odd = odd.next
            even = even.next
        odd.next = eHead
        return head
```
