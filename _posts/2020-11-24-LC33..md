        1. mid point is pivot point 
        2. mid ptr is between ascending sorted arr ==> how to find lo/hi?? => compare mid ptr with most left and most right [l, mid) and (mid,r]; That says, mid ptr is switching roles as left ptr and right ptr between corresponding sorted sub arrays
        3. within sorted subarray, compare target value with (arr[mid] and arr[l]/arr[r]) 
        
        step1, if arr[mid] == target
        step2, if left is sorted[l, mid) => arr[mid] >= arr[l]
            step2.1 if target within range  [l, mid), r = mid -1 
            step2.2 if not, l = mid 
        step3, if right is sorted[mid,r] => arr[mid]  <= arr[r]
