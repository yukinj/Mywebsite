        main idea: use 2 pointers to keep track with current interval pairs available to be processed
        
        two questions to consider: 1. how to decide overlap ranges 2. when to move to next interval 
        
        edge case: one of ptr reached to the end == > loop stops,  so we decide while loop  condition is both p1, p2 not run out
        """
        n1,n2 = len(A), len(B)
        p1= p2= 0
        res = []
        while p1 < n1 and p2 < n2:
            As,Ae = A[p1]
            Bs,Be = B[p2]
            #  # Criss-cross lock
            if As <= Be and Bs <= Ae: 
                overlap_s, overlap_e = max(As,Bs),min(Ae,Be)
                res.append([overlap_s,overlap_e])
            
            # after comparisn 
            if Ae <= Be: # exhaust range in A, point to next range in A
                p1 += 1
            else: # exhaust range in B, point to next range in B
                p2 += 1
        return res
