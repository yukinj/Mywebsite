Stack Solution by building a Binary Tree
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:
        """ tc O(N) sc O(N)
when you iterate through the preorder traversal string, for each char:

case 1: you see a number c, means you begin to expand a new tree rooted with c, you push it to stack

case 2.1: you see a #, while top of stack is a number, you know this # is a left null child, put it there as a mark for next coming node k to know it is being the right child.

case 2.2: you see a #, while top of stack is #, you know you meet this # as right null child, you now cancel the sub tree (rooted as t, for example) with these two-# children. But wait, after the cancellation, you continue to check top of stack is whether # or a number:

---- if a number, say u, you know you just cancelled a node t which is left child of u. You need to leave a # mark to the top of stack. So that the next node know it is a right child.

---- if a #, you know you just cancelled a tree whose root, t, is the right child of u. So you continue to cancel sub tree of u, and the process goes on and on.
