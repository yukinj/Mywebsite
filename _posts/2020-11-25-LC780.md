main idea:
1. for nth tx,ty, ( assuming tx > ty),  the nth tx comes from the (n-1)th tx + the (n-1)th ty  ==> in order to make ty, tx increase, there has to be a difference between these two number  
2. for any sx > tx or sy > ty, there is no chance will change 
3. there is a case when tx == ts, which means all the time only ty is changed ==> ty = sy + k* sx, in this case, just to check if (ty-sy) % sx == 0 
```python
class Solution:
# time O(lg(max(ty,tx)))  space O(1)
    def reachingPoints(self, sx: int, sy: int, tx: int, ty: int) -> bool:
        # big assumption: ty >= sy and tx >= sx 
        while ty >= sy and tx >= sx:
        # case 1  ty == tx 
            if ty == tx:
                break    
         # case2  ty > tx 
            # case 2.1 ty > sy  
            # case 2.2 ty <= sy
            elif ty > tx :
                if tx > sx:
                    ty = ty % tx 
                else:
                    return (ty-sy)% tx == 0
        
        # case3  ty <= tx 
            # case 3.1 tx > sx
            # case 3.2 tx <= sy
            else:
                if ty > sy :
                    tx  = tx%ty 
                else:
                    return (tx-sx)%ty == 0        
        return ty == sy and tx ==sx
