main idea:
1. for nth tx,ty, ( assuming tx > ty),  the nth tx comes from the (n-1)th tx + the (n-1)th ty  ==> in order to make ty, tx increase, there has to be a difference between these two number  
2. for any sx > tx or sy > ty, there is no chance will change 
3. there is a case when tx == ts, which means all the time only ty is changed ==> ty = sy + k* sx, in this case, just to check if (ty-sy) % sx == 0 
```python
class Solution:
# time O(lg(max(ty,tx)))  space O(1)
    def reachingPoints(self, sx: int, sy: int, tx: int, ty: int) -> bool:
        # big assumption: ty >= sy and tx >= sx 
        while sx <= tx and sy <= ty:
            # case 1  ty == tx 
            if tx == ty:
                break
            # case2  ty > tx 
            # case 2.1 ty > sy  
            # case 2.2 ty <= sy
            elif ty > tx:
                if tx == sx:
                    return (ty-sy)%sx == 0
                ty = ty % tx
            # case3  ty <= tx 
            # case 3.1 tx > sx
            # case 3.2 tx <= sy 
            elif ty < tx:
                if ty == sy:
                    return (tx-sx)%sy == 0 
                tx = tx%ty
        return sx == tx and sy == ty
```
