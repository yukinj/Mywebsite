        find min capacity to carry all weights in A and total time cost <= D
        => estimate capacity = ceil ((total weight) /D )
        constrains:  each package a is not splitable   => left pointer need to be bigger than any single package weight 
                        use Binary Search to adjust capacity 
        how about right ptr?  sum of A
        1. get sum of A and average of A 
        2. get mid and count time cost to ship all packages based on the mid capacity
        3. find smallest valid mid
