```python
# time O(N) space O(1)

main idea: choose 1st element means last one can not be choosen. not chooen 1st element means last element can be an option to choose( not determined)=> valid loop range will be correspondinglly [0,len(nums)-1] and [1,len(nums)-2].since loop range differs, we need to discuss in two loops.
Hence we create a general loop body for getting maximum from current choices within valid ranges.

step1: edge case: len(nums) = 0 |len(nums) = 1
step2: two cases => 1. choose 1st element 2. not choose 1st elemenet
    2.1: given start, end point, loop through nums, record previous rob actions and based on previous actions to get current most optimal gains
    2.2 update previous actions by assigning current optimal to previous record since next loop current action will be recaculated.
step3: compare max gains from two cases above, get final max
