```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, A: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        """ tc O(N) sc O(1) (assuming each item in A is non-negtive )
        1. corner case if target < 0
        2. left, right ptr start with head. start with K, keep substract current item the right ptr pointing at
        3. keep reduce target K untill K < 0, start moving left ptr until K >=0
        4. each time we find a valid window [l,r], we add its length into res so we get the amount of subarrays within this subArray  
        
        """
        def atMost(K): # number of subarray at most goal
            if K < 0:
                return 0
            res = l = 0
            for r in range(len(A)):
                K -= A[r]
                while K < 0:
                    S += A[l]
                    l += 1
