```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # main idea: use nums itself as bucket,each element should store at a position(idx) correspoing to their value. otherwise, swap in place; loop twice until find the one number not indicating idex, return the expected value, otherwise, return last in the array.
        # why using while loop?  because after one swap, the original element at index i will go to the correct position, but updated element at index i may not be at the same postion. So we need to swap it again until element at index i is at correct position, then we can move to index i++1  
        size = len(nums)
        for i in range(size):
            while 0 < nums[i] <= size and nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]:
                self.swap(nums,nums[i]-1,i)
        for i in range(size):
            if nums[i]-1 != i:
                return i+1
        return size + 1 
        
    def swap(self,arr,idx1,idx2):
        arr[idx1],arr[idx2] = arr[idx2],arr[idx1]
