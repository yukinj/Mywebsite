        """ O(N)/O(1)
        in order to find first missing positive, need to make sure array sorted 
        1. loop through num, take num-1 as idx, place num to sorted order (not num is within [0,N])
        2. loop array, if nums[i]-1 != i, i+1 the first missing positive number(here solves case when all numbers >N, since in that case return 1 and i+1 = 1 ) 
        3. if after loop, all numbers are at the right place, return N +1
