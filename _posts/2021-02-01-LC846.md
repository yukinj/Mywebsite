```

Follow up: (1) print all the straight (2)  if W is huge, should we cut off card one by one?

PQ solution
```python
# tc O(MlgM + N )
class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:
        c = collections.Counter(hand)
        q = collections.deque()
        last_checked_val, opened_cnt = -1,0
        for x in sorted(c):
            # smallest number's cnt > next val    next val is not consecutive and previous value still have cnt 
            if opened_cnt > c[x] or            opened_cnt >0 and x > last_checked_val +1 :return False
            q.append(c[x]-opened_cnt)
            last_checked_val= x # mark last visited val and last visited cnt  
            opened_cnt  = c[x]  
            if len(q) == W:
                opened_cnt -= q.popleft()
        return opened_cnt == 0
