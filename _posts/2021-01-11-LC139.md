```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        
        # time O(N^3)
        n = len(s)
        dp = [False] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = True
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] != False and s[j:i] in wordDict:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        return dp[n]

```

for this kind of problem, which time complexity is [length of s][size of dict][avg length of words in dict]. We can usually remove [size of dict] by using Tire, remove [avg length of words in dict] by KMP, and what's more, remove both [size of dict] and [avg length of words in dict] by AC-automata. And of course these are all doable for this problem.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        
        # time O(N^3)
        n = len(s)
        dp = [False] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = True
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for ss in wordDict:
                ss_len = len(ss)
                if ss_len <= i: 
                    if dp[i-ss_len] == True:
                        if s[i-ss_len:i] == ss:
                            dp[i] = True
                            break
        return dp[n]
```
