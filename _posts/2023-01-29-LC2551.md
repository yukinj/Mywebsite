        main idea: select top largest k and smallest k elements. 
        edge case:  (1) k = len(weights) -> max -min = 0 (2) k = 1, everything put in one bag 
        general case:  need to put k-1 bars in between n stones, for 3th stone,put a bar at end of 3th stone, total scores increase by weights[3] + weights[4] -> need to record weights[i] + weights[i+1] and find the k-1 smallest / largest  
            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
        tc O(NlgN)  sc(N)
        """
        scores = []
        n = len(weights)
        if k == 1 or k == n:return 0 # optimize, but can skip 
        for i in range(n-1):
            scores.append(weights[i]+weights[i+1])
        scores.sort()
