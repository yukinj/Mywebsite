Classic LCS 2D  solution 
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
        """
        tc O(M*N) sc O(M*N)
        
        """
        m,n = len(s1), len(s2)
        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j],dp[i][j+1])
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
