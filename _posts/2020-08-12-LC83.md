#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
# time O(N)  space O(1)

        if not head or not head.next:
            return head 
        cur = head 
        # (1)if current val is == next val ,keep move next forward, until first time next is different 
        #(2)connect current's next to next
        #(3) move current to its next
        while cur:
            nxt = cur.next
