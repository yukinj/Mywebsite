```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
# time O(N)  space O(1)
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        p = head
        # edge case1:  head is None; case2:  head has only one value
        if not p or not p.next:
            return head 
        while p.next:
            if p.next.val == p.val:  # here assume there is next, so we need to make sure p.next exist 
                p.next = p.next.next
            else: # here can't remove else because, not sure if next number is the same. or else we will miss a repeated number 
                p = p.next
        return head
